# Conradi_toroid
Mathematical description of Pim Conradi's toroid of intersecting curved wood

Decide on an r value in cylindrical polar co-ordinates where you will end the tilted ellipse.  Find the 3D gradient at these points. Read from the photo the r value where the inside surface crosses the xy plane. The Bezier curves will be defined by these 5 points and ratates by 30 degrees.
